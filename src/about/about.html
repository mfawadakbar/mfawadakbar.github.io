        <p class="bold">
          I'm Chris, a Ph.D. student at Utah State University.
          I specialize in artificial intelligence, data science, and multi-agent systems.
          Occasionally I also create websites and virtual reality video games.
          I've been a graduate student at Utah State University since 2018 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2017.

          I consider myself a generalist who specializes in machine learning.
          I do a bit of everything that goes into building an artificial intelligence, from finding and cleaning data, to sharing and presenting the results of my research.

          I strive to be an individual that colleagues seek for questions in their research and experiments.
          To be this person, I keep up with the latest advances in topics not only in artificial intelligence and machine learning but also other related topics like neuroscience and cyber-security.
          I enjoy working with others as opposed to my own due to the sharing and discussing of ideas that allow a deeper understanding of the problem.
